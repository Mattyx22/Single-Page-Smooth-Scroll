# Single-Page-Smooth-Scroll
SPSS is a simple and easy to use script which helps to create single page websites for portfolio or product presentation

It is not finished project. I just wanted to have backup here :)

Demo:
-

Usage:
After download you get everything which is needed to use (template too).
But if you want to know hot to create slides on single page you just have to create something like this:
```
<main>
  <section id="slide_1">...</section>
  <section id="slide_2">...</section>
  ....
  ....
  <section id="slide_6">...</section>
</main>
```
